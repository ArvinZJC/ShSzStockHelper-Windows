# [ShSzStockHelper-Windows](../../..)/ShSzStockSymbolNameData

**English** | [简体中文](./README-zhCN.md)

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file with Python code to retrieve and store a list of symbols and corresponding names of SH/SZ stocks in a JSON file which is a part of the resources of the application. The JSON file is processed to provide the autocomplete functionality of the text box control for inputing the symbol of an SH/SZ stock.

## ATTENTION

1. The IPYNB file can be opened and edited in Visual Studio Code (if supported). By 20 June 2021, everything looks good with the code editor (Version: 1.57.1). As an option, you can also use Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda. In addition, I would like to thank [TuShare Pro](https://tushare.pro/) for its valuabale data. The primary packages used in the development are listed in the following table.

    | Name | Version |
    | :--: | :--: |
    | python | 3.8.10 |
    | tushare | 1.2.62 |
    | pandas | 1.2.4 |
