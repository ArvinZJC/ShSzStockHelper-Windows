# [ShSzStockHelper-Windows](https://github.com/ArvinZJC/ShSzStockHelper-Windows)/ShSzStockSymbolNameData

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file with Python code to retrieve and store a list of symbols and corresponding names of SH/SZ stocks in a JSON file which is a part of the resources of the application. The JSON file is processed to provide the autocomplete functionality of the text box control for inputing the symbol of an SH/SZ stock.

## ATTENTION

1. By 15 September 2020, everything looks good with Jupyter Notebook 6.1.1 in Anaconda. As an option, the IPYNB file can also be opened and edited in Visual Studio Code (if supported) with Anaconda activated. In addition, I would like to thank [TuShare Pro](https://tushare.pro/) for its valuabale data. The main packages used in the development are listed in Table 1.

| Name | Version |
| :-- | :--: |
| python | 3.7.7 |
| tushare | 1.2.60 |
