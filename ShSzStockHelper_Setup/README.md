This is the Advanced Installer project folder of the application setup file. The files in the folder are mainly used to build the latest application setup file (.exe) with user-friendly UI. The setup file can install/modify/uninstall the application on the computer.

## Partial UI

## ATTENTION

1. By 27 December 2020, everything looks good with Advanced Installer 17.3. I would greatly show my appreciation of this handful setup tool which improves the performance of the application setup file.
2. The type of this installer project is **Architect**.
